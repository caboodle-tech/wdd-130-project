# Branches
Git branches are used for many reasons but are primarily used to create, track, and work on a *branch* of your main code. Many companies use branches to track work-in-progress builds, bug fixes, new features, and so on. Here is a helpful list of resources to help you use branches in your project:

- [Adding and deleting branches](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging). NOTE: Many companies use codes or shorthand names for their branches, you do not have to.
- [Delete a branch locally and remotely](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-delete-a-git-branch-both-locally-and-remotely/).
